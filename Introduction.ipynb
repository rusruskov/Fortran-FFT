To add up the two results we need another $N$ steps, so that the total is $N^2/2 + N$. Note that there is a slight abuse of notation here. The DFT's on the even and odd elements produce arrays which are $N/2$ long while $k$ runs from $0$ to $N-1$. This fixed by setting $\\text{DFT}(x_\\text{even})[k+N/2] = \\text{DFT}(x_\\text{even})[k]$ (similarly for the odd elements)."

Then we will have $N^2/2^p + p \\times N$ operations to do. Thus the complexity now is $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log_2 N)$. This is the radix-2 Cooley-Tukey algorithm used to compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)."
